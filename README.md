- 😄 Hi there 👋 My name is Katy!
- 🔭 I'm currently working on how all things associated with Front-End Development!
- 🌱 I have already learned HTML5, CSS, git, version control, command line, this wonderful place known as GitHub and finally Javascript! Now onto some more lessons!
- 🔭 Still learning but hope to become a Front-End Developer in the VERY near future!
- 👯 I'm looking to build a website for anyone who isn't in a hurry to have one (at a nice and happy low price).
- 📫 Reach me via my email: ksaldinger@gmail.com
-  ⚡ Fun fact: My kids convinced me that we need pet snails. They are persuasive; the snails are named Speedy and Zippy! I now am a fan of snails, who knew?!🐌
